# Technical Documentation
A Free Code Camp project.

This project was an exercise in responsive design. The actual content is mostly nonsense so don't rely on it to get you started on a coding journey.

It is a simple, single webpage that demonstrates some of the responsive design fundamentals. In this case, a media break point is the obvious responsive feature. Outside of that not a lot happens but the content is dynamically generated and can more easily be updated or added to with the simple addition of an object to the data.js file.

## Use of this Project
Clone the file project and open the index.html file. It is pretty simple. 
*JavaScript must be enabled to see any of the content.*
